Observation about coffee in the UK:

Most espresso drinks I had there were decent but not outstanding. Meanwhile, none of the drip coffee was remotely as bad as the swill thatâ€™s so common in the States. (I did see a few Starbucks, but I avoided them there just as I do here because their coffee is unpalatable.)
