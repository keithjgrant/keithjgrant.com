That episode of the Great British Baking show where they make “American pies” but Paul makes it abundantly clear a) he doesn’t like American pies, and b) he doesn’t have a clue what constitutes an American pie.

Then most of the contestants proceed to make tarts that are decidedly neither American nor pies. Though one guy makes a rocking proper American key lime pie, and Paul says he loves it even though it wasn&#39;t what he asked for.
