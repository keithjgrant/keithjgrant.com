With the recent discontentment on Twitter (and social media in general), I’ve seen a resurgence of people returning to blogging. In particular, I’ve noticed more folks posting short entries, or _notes_, to their blog &mdash; either in addition to Twitter, or in place of it.

If you are interested in doing this, _micropub_ is a great way to make it a frictionless experience. Micropub is a new W3C standard, allowing you to post directly to your site using third-party apps.

I recently wrote a quick overview how to get started with micropub as part of the [Omnibear](https://omnibear.com) documentation. Check it out.
