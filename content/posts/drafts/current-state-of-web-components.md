Desired WC Goals:
* encapsulation
* composable interfaces

Common wishlist ideas:
* declarative API
* app state management

misc:
* The native APIs aren't as bad as you think. If you’ve been stuck in React-land for the past couple years, pick a small project to implement in vanilla JS. I think you’ll be surprised. [array methods, templates, etc] It’s not perfect, by any means, but it’s a lot better than you remember.
* Some people want WC to integrate with app state management engine. Leave this to the libraries. This is still an evolving area, and I don’t think we’re ready to calcify anything into the native platform yet.
* Don’t you dare say WC don’t provide anything your framework already provides. It provides truly encapsulated CSS!
* You can’t both want a) for WC to replace React and b) to re-implement the entire browser in React
* There is a lot of confusion, misinformation, and conflicting desires from the web community regarding what WC should become.
* I will grant that Raw DOM manipulation, event binding, and firing events in vanilla JS in too verbose. But I posit that’s a separate problem. And it is getting better, bit by bit.
