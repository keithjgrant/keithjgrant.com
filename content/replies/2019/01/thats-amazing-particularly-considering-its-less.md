That’s amazing. Particularly considering it’s less than a week old. In my experience, there’s typically a “Buffer delay” between when a popular post gets published and when it really takes off—because everyone tends to throw the links into their Buffer, which is usually backed up a couple weeks.

So I have a feeling you’re going to see that number *really* take off 💪🏻
