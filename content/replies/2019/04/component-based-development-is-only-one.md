Component-based development is only one of Reactâ€™s revolutionary changes in frontend dev.

Other significant ones to consider are the ability to declarative modify the DOM, application of functional programming ideas to the front end, uni-directional data-flow with a single source of truth, and now (with hooks) major improvements in code organization and re-use of common patterns.

Web Components are fantastic, but they are low-level. The do NOT provide these other significant benefits.
