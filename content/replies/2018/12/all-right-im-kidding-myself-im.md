All right, I’m kidding myself. I’m not going to get to this today, at least not in full depth. But I do want to say this much: I hope you don’t take that subtweet of mine as criticism.

Just because some of your points don’t speak to me directly doesn’t mean they won’t speak to others. And I think that’s kind of the point with this CSS-in-JS stuff: the webdev world is broad. The projects we build vary wildly. The CSS-in-JS tools vary wildly. The technical needs of various teams vary wildly. What works for me won’t automatically work for you.

This is why we have Webpack AND Rollup AND Parcel AND out-of-the-box configurations like Next.js and create-react-app. There is no one size fits all. Nobody needs—absolutely needs—cij. It can all be done with a reasonable amount of discipline and vanilla CSS + a preprocessor. But cij can make life easier for some projects, and I think that’s the long and short of it.
