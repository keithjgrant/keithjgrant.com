“building react into css” -&gt; I assume you mean into JS?

React the library will be outdated eventually, but I think it has brought enormous shifts to how we build out component-based architectures that will last. JS can now be written in a more declarative way, and centralized state management plus uni-directional data flow makes code much simpler and less error prone.

I *really* hope those benefits can make their way into the web platform.
