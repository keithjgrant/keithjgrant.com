Honestly, I’d totally forgotten about unpkg.

I suppose the one key difference would be the client-side decision (based on semver) whether to make a network request for the package or use one already in cache that matches e.g. `^1.3.4`.

There’s probably no reason a lightweight browser extension couldn’t do that for unpkg today, though you’d have to drive adoption somehow.
